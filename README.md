# moodle-block_dukreminder
Moodle Block to set reminders for students, for example if a course is not completed after a certain date. 
It is used and developed at the Donau University Krems - thus the abbreviated name. The main idea and concept stems from Gerhard Schwed <gerhard.schwed@donau-uni.ac.at>.
